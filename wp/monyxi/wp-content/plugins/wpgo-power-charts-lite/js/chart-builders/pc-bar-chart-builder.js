/* Power Charts - Bar chart builder */

jQuery( document ).ready( function( $ ) {

	// Need this?

	// Just build the chart JS here (called every time the chart type changes)

	// Should this be enqueued only on the 'Add New' chart page. I don't think we need it once the chart has been created?
	// If we don't separate out the config settings then we may still need to build the whole chart JS.

	// make this a general purpose chart builder that is a regular function that takes in the data and other settings(?)

	// ---

	// STEP 1 - NEED TO GET POST ID AND INSERT THIS FOR SOME PARTS OF THE CODE

	// STEP 2 - For rebuild, get all chart data from meta boxes not db

	// STEP 3 - Make a general render (not rebuild function) to only rerender the new chart based on new data
