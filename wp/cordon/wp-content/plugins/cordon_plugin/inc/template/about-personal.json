Daniel assists Lola in the distribution of water. With the Ranch dangerously low on resources, Madison and Walker leave in search of a solution. Nick and Alicia struggle to keep the peace.\n\nDiscontent is growing in the country, and upon hearing the pleas of a silk weaver of Spitalfields, Victoria decides she must help. Against Peel and Albert’s advice, she hatches a plan: a fantastic medieval ball at the Palace, where the attendees have to wear costumes made from Spitalfields silk. Meanwhile, having received no recent news from Lord Melbourne, Victoria grows increasingly concerned. She sends Emma to check up on her old friend to make sure all is well. Despite his initial protestations, and struggling to find his place as a Prince Consort and husband, Albert allows himself to be seduced by the grandeur of the event, and the opportunity to finally wear a crown. When the ball arrives, it provides the perfect backdrop for old friends to reunite and romances to ignite, but it doesn’t receive the positive response from the nation that Victoria had hoped.","panels_info":{"class":"rdn_title_line_widget","raw":false,"grid":0,"cell":1,"id":1,"widget_id":"fcd0f60c-56a9-42cb-8cfb-ec6ebc1fbdf4","style":{"background_display":"tile"}}},{"title":"A creative man is motivated by the desire to achieve, not by the desire to beat others.","panels_info":{"class":"rdn_block_quote_widget","raw":false,"grid":0,"cell":1,"id":2,"widget_id":"08884d99-ee24-421b-b463-4d884ff9ecae","style":{"padding":"0px 0px 0px 0px","background_image_attachment":false,"background_display":"tile"}}},{"title":"What can i do?","text":"Laura is betrayed by Tom and learns that Serena is at the TV station and fears her daughter will suffer the same original fate she did.
